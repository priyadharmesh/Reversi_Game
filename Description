Reversi Game
Type: Academic Project
Skills: Advanced C++, Command-line Interface, Game Mechanics, Algorithmic Skills
Description: This project involved creating a command-line version of the classic board game Reversi (Othello). 
Utilizing advanced C++ programming, I developed the core game mechanics, including board setup, move validation, and piece flipping. 
The game board is initialized with the starting positions of the pieces. 
Players take turns placing their pieces on the board, aiming to flip the opponent's pieces to their color by trapping them between two of their own pieces. 
Each move involves checking its validity based on the game rules, which required implementing efficient algorithms to verify and execute moves. 
The command-line interface provides an intuitive way for players to input their moves and receive feedback, enhancing user engagement through clear prompts and messages. This project sharpened my skills in algorithmic problem-solving and demonstrated my ability to implement complex game mechanics in a structured manner.
